# BlockedScreens
a set of fake "your computer is blocked!!!" screens. (THIS IS AN INSIDE JOKE FOR MY SCHOOL)

NOTE: The coding is usually very bad, and some depricated tags are used. I know.

Also these look bad intentionally.

And, if someone *somehow* finds this and you want to add a screen or change something, just make a pull request, i'll probably merge it lol.
